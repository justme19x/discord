# discord bot

Discord Bot Project – A Python-based bot created with discord.py, designed to combine fun features and practical utilities. 
It responds to certain keywords in chat with personalized messages, manages custom roles, and provides a complete music system (play, pause, resume, skip, queue, replay, and leave) using yt_dlp and FFmpeg.
Beyond entertainment, it integrates with the Riot Games API to fetch and display detailged Leaue of Legends statistics—including champion mastery, rank, winrate, and live game status.
This project was built using API integration, asynchronous programming, and bot development for Discord.
